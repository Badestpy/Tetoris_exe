# The Indefinitly Spinning Teto
its a gif, as an EXE

Read Dev_Documentation.txt for more context as to what this is and its purpose.
I do not own the .gif nor the .ico, I found this gif on Tenor and the .ico was a converted .jpg

.ico original image address : https://64.media.tumblr.com/5119753d4212617a9e12f347a8c42c91/523fb1ed7e7e1a07-5c/s500x750/26522aa66ebb38fd6081d1b217e421bd5449818e.png

Here is an example of what this monstrosity looks like in action:

granted, this is with multiple instances open.


Known issues:
- its not good, again, never was supposed to be
- the .exe hits an error, can't find .mp3 in SYSTEM32
